# Flight Booking System

## Problem Domain
Efficiently managing the process of booking, canceling, and modifying flight reservations is critical for the travel industry. Traditional methods can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, leading to customer dissatisfaction. The problem domain involves:
- Difficulty in managing real-time seat availability.
- Inefficient searching and sorting of flights.
- Ensuring secure and reliable payment mechanisms.
- Handling large-scale concurrent bookings.

## Solution Domain
The Flight Booking System offers a comprehensive solution:
- A web-based platform for searching, booking, and managing flight reservations.
- Real-time seat availability updates.
- Integration of secure payment gateways for seamless transactions.
- Scalability to handle a large number of concurrent users.
- An intuitive interface for users, airlines, and administrators.

## Software Requirements
### Frontend:
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- React.js (for dynamic UI components)

### Backend:
- Node.js (server-side logic)
- Express.js (framework)

### Database:
- MySQL (data storage and retrieval)

### Additional Tools:
- JWT (authentication and security)
- Stripe API (payment gateway integration)
- Nginx (server hosting and load balancing)

## Data Structures Used
### 1. **Arrays and Lists**:
   - For storing flight details, user information, and booking records.
### 2. **Hash Tables**:
   - To manage efficient lookups for flights and user data.
### 3. **Graphs**:
   - Representing flight routes and connections between cities.
### 4. **Priority Queue**:
   - For managing customer support queries and urgent booking tasks.
### 5. **Cache (LRU)**:
   - To store frequently accessed flight search results for efficiency.

## Methodology
### **1. Problem Analysis:**
   - Identify key pain points in flight booking and management.
   - Define system goals and user requirements.

### **2. System Design:**
   - Follow the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture for scalability and modularity.
   - Create user flows and database schemas.

### **3. Implementation:**
   - Develop frontend using React.js for a responsive UI.
   - Build backend with Node.js and Express.js for API handling.
   - Integrate MySQL for database operations.

### **4. Testing:**
   - Unit testing for each module.
   - Load testing to ensure the system can handle concurrent users.

### Space and Time Complexity:
   - **Flight Search:** Optimized using binary search for O(log n) complexity.
   - **Graph Traversal:** Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstraâ€™s) for route optimization.
   - **Caching:** LRU cache for O(1) average access time.

## Conclusion
The Flight Booking System addresses the challenges of modern-day flight management by leveraging robust data structures and methodologies. It offers a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly platform, ensuring customer satisfaction and operational efficiency for airlines. With future enhancements like dynamic pricing and AI-driven recommendations, the system has the potential to revolutionize the travel booking experience.
